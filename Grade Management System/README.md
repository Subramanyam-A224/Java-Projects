# Grade Management System

## Project Overview
The Grade Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage and track student grades efficiently. The system allows for adding, updating, and retrieving student information, including their grades, providing a streamlined way to handle grade management for educational institutions.

## Features
- Add, update, and delete student records.
- Calculate and display grades.
- Generate reports for student performance.
  
## Skills Demonstrated
- **Java Core Concepts**: Utilized Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to design classes like `Student` and `GradeManagementSystem`.
- **Data Structures**: Implemented arrays and lists to store and manage student data.
- **File Handling**: Managed data persistence using file input/output operations.
- **Problem-Solving**: Applied logical and analytical skills to implement features like grade calculations and report generation.
